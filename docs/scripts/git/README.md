# Git Utility Scripts

This directory is intended for documentation related to various Git utility scripts.

## Scripts

- **cmmt-ai.sh** (Documentation located in `docs/scripts/commit/`)
  - Uses AI (via Ollama) to help generate Git commit messages.

Currently, `cmmt-ai.sh` is the primary Git-related script with dedicated documentation. As more Git utilities are added, their documentation will be listed here.
