# Webnodex/devtoolkit an Opinionated Developer Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the `webnodex/devtoolkit` repository! This project is a collection of utility scripts and configurations designed to streamline common development tasks, improve code quality, and enhance the overall developer experience.

## Features

This toolkit provides a range of scripts for:

- **Git Workflow Automation**: Tools for conventional commits, AI-assisted commit message generation, and Git-aware command execution.
- **Code Quality & Linting**: Scripts for linting Markdown files and potentially other code types.
- **File Management**: Utilities like `chmodx.sh` for managing file permissions.
- **Developer Experience**: Integration with tools like Lefthook for automated Git hooks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webnodex/devtoolkit.git
   cd devtoolkit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
